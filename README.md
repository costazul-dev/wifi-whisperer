# Wi-Fi Whisperer 

A passive device listens for Wi-Fi probe requests from nearby phones â€” the little digital cries for places they once connected to. These remembered network names (SSIDs) are collected, filtered, and fed into an AI model that ranks them daily based on humor, weirdness, and emotional undertones.

A poetic surveillance system. A joke machine. A quiet eavesdropper on memory.
